This gem (hopefully) is temporary, pending these two pull requests:

[rethinkdb#5973](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/5973)
[nobrainer#192](https://github.com/nviennot/nobrainer/pull/192)

If they are merged I will disable this gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nobrainer_streams'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nobrainer_streams

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
